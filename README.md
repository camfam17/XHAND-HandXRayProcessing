# Capstone Project: X-Hand Image Processing
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to take a set of hand x-ray images and to segment each image to recover the 
hand. Once the hands have been extracted, the images will then be aligned with the reference image and then visualised and analysed. All the required operations for the image processing pipeline will be done using python. 
The project uses MVC architectural design pattern.
